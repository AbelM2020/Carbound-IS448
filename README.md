# Carbound

**Carbound** is a multi-page PHP and MariaDB website created for **IS 448**.  
The project is a fictional profile site for *Aiden Torque*, an underground car builder known as “The Rogue Mechanic.”

The site allows visitors to browse a catalog of custom car builds, learn about Aiden’s background, and contact him for restoration or tuning work. A protected admin panel allows authorized users to manage the car catalog.
